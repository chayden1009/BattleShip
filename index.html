    <h1>BATTLESHIP</h1>
    <h2>THE RULES:</h2>
    <article>BATTLESHIP is played one on one. Each player is given 5 ships of varying length to place around their respective boards. Once both players are ready, the game may begin. Each player may see their board, but not that of the enemy. They then take turns aiming and firing at a chosen position on the opposing board, and are informed whether they hit an enemy ship, or if they missed. This information is marked on the board for the remainder of the round. The game continues until one player has sunk the rest of their enemy's ships. </article>
