# BattleShip
## Description
Battleship is played with 2 players. Each is given 5 ships to place on their board which the enemy cannot see. The goal of both players is to guess where the enemy ships are, and track where a hit was registered, doing so continuously until the enemy has no ships left.

The aim of this project is to recreate the game in a browser environment with full functionality, as well as provide a cpu for the player to face in the absence of a human adversary.
